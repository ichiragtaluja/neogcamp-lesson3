        <p class="blog-text">Here are some interesting facts about JavaScript:</p>
        <div class="blog-list">
    <ul >
        <p><li>JavaScript was created in just 10 days by Netscape programmer Brendan Eich in 1995. It was originally called LiveScript, but was renamed to JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java. Despite the similar names, JavaScript has no relation to Java other than the marketing strategy.</li></p>
        <p><li>In 2013, a developer named Paul Irish created a website called "Divine JavaScript," which claimed to be a "miracle programming language" that could solve any problem with just a few lines of code. The site was actually a parody of the hype surrounding JavaScript, and included jokes about "self-referential functions" and "quantum variable hoisting."</li></p>
        <p><li>In 2014, a developer named Brett Slatkin created a website called "The JavaScript Collection," which claimed to be a "museum of the finest examples of JavaScript in the world." The site was actually a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the weird and wonderful things that people can do with JavaScript, and included examples like "a JavaScript implementation of Flappy Bird" and "a JavaScript implementation of Tetris."</li></p>
        <p><li>JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world, with over 10 million developers using it.</li></p>
